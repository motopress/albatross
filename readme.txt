Albatross is a stylish free Elementor Hotel Booking theme. Itâ€™s designed specifically for building a hotel, vacation rental, B&B, apartment, or any other type of rental property website.

For design and layout changes, Albatross relies on the flexibility and power of Elementor backed by Stratum, a collection of fantastic Elementor widgets. An elegant, mobile-ready design of the Albatross WordPress hotel template uses many Elementor-powered content blocks, including breathtaking image galleries, animated flip boxes, contact forms, maps, and more.
